# bic-coding-schemes
This repository implements various coding schemes for spiking neural networks (SNNs) based on the paper by Guo et al. (2021). The coding schemes include rate coding, time-to-first-spike coding, phase-coding and burst coding.

# Coding Schemes

## Rate Coding

Rate coding encodes information by using the spike rate to represent the strength of the input signal. In biological systems, neurons communicate by varying their spike frequency; a higher firing rate typically indicates a stronger signal. In this implementation:

- High pixel intensity corresponds to a high firing rate.
- Low pixel intensity corresponds to a low firing rate.

The implementation scales pixel intensities by a factor (λ = 4), so that pixel values in the range 0–255 translate to firing rates between 0 and 63.75 Hz. The key idea is to compute the spike probability for each pixel as:

$$p_{spike} = (pixel_{value} / scaling_{factor}) × dt$$

A Poisson spike train is generated by comparing the computed probability with a uniformly distributed random number for every time step. In essence, higher pixel intensities yield higher probabilities of spiking, while lower intensities yield lower probabilities.
